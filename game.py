#make_character returns dictionary?
# {"status": {"hp" : , "mp": , "level" : }}
#describe current location returns
#get user choice uses a enumerated list and returns a
#check for challenges returns true or false
#character carreis around a dictionary that is basically it's global status
#once boss is beaten, leave the main game loop;
# to move, the game prints out a list for us and we select an element out of it
# make_board returns a dictionary?? Yes, it returns a dictionary with tuples/coordinates as keys?
# combat: combat_was_a_success function causes player level ups
# probability of encounters is 20% at beignning

# add .idea/ to git ignore

# git conflict (pushing w/o pulling first)
# PULL first: merge incoming changes to branch

# ----
# check assignment 4 pdf: main game loop

# give users choices: no need for combat system.

# goal: level up to three, then boss encounter

# don't use .get

#use enumerate() for user choices
